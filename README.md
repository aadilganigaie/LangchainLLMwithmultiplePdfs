# LangchainLLMwithmultiplePdfs
PDFChatBot: A PDF interaction tool powered by LangChain and LLM for natural language querying and document summarization.

Description:

PDFChatBot is an interactive tool that enables users to extract information and ask questions about multiple PDF documents using the LangChain and Language Model (LLM) technologies. With PDFChatBot, users can effortlessly upload and process any number of PDF files, then engage in natural language conversations with a powerful language model to gain insights, retrieve information, and ask questions related to the content of the uploaded PDFs.

Key Features:

PDF Document Processing: PDFChatBot allows users to upload and process multiple PDF documents simultaneously.

Natural Language Interaction: Engage in conversational interactions with a state-of-the-art Language Model powered by LangChain.

Document Summarization: Automatically extract and summarize text from uploaded PDFs for easy reference.

Question-Answering: Ask questions about the content of the PDFs, and PDFChatBot will provide detailed answers based on its understanding of the documents.

Efficient Search: Quickly search through large volumes of text within PDFs using advanced embeddings and retrieval techniques.

Convenient User Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy navigation and interaction.

Customizable Models: Choose from a selection of pre-trained language models or integrate your preferred models for fine-tuned performance.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies and set up your Python environment.
Run the application using Streamlit.
Upload your PDF documents and start asking questions.
Explore the generated summaries and answers.
